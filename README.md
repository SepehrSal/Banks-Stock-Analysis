# Banks-Stock-Data
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices.

We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.

this project is to practice visualization and pandas skills, it is parctice for a robust financial analysis.


this project has 3 parts:
* get data
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization

I got data using Yahoo Finance datareader. I got stock information for the following banks:

*  Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

* calculating the Return for each bank's stock
* the riskiest stock over the entire time period
* calculating the moving averages for stocks

Visualization
