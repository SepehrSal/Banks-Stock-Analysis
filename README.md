We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

this project has 3cparts:
* get data
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualization

I got data using Yahoo Finance datareader. I got stock information for the following banks:

*  Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

* calculating the Return for each bank's stock
